    "**Question 1: Handling Mixed Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Imagine you're given a dataset with customer purchase records (structured data) and a separate file of customer reviews (unstructured text). Describe your initial approach for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both types of data to find potential insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "For the structured data (purchase records), I would load the data into Pandas and use `df.info() ` and ` df.describe()` to inspect its structure, data types, and summary statistics. I’d check for missing values, outliers (using boxplots or IQR), and distributions (histograms for numerical columns like purchase amount, bar plots for categorical columns like product categories) to identify patterns such as top-selling items or peak purchase times. For the unstructured text (reviews), I’d use NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy to preprocess the text (tokenization, lowercasing, stop-word removal) and perform word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis (e.g., VADER), and topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to uncover common themes or sentiment trends. By joining the datasets on a common key (e.g., customer ID), I’d correlate purchase behavior (e.g., high spenders) with review sentiment or topics, revealing insights like whether frequent buyers leave more positive reviews. This dual approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of both quantitative and qualitative patterns.\n"

    "**Question 2: Data Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Describe a complex data cleaning or transformation task you have performed in a past project. What was the problem, what tools did you use (e.g., Pandas, SQL), and what were the main challenges you faced?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Fraud-detection-for-e-commerce\" project, I worked on a complex data cleaning and transformation task involving transaction records collected from multiple e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "The raw data was highly inconsistent and messy. Each data source had its own format, with issues such as missing values, inconsistent column types, duplicate records, ill-formatted timestamps, and categorical variables with typos or different naming conventions (for example, “credit card” vs. “CreditCard” vs. “cc”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Used:**  \n",
    "- Pandas (Python)\n",
    "- NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Steps and Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Consolidation:**  \n",
    "   I had to merge datasets from different sources. Many columns overlapped but had different names or types, so I mapped and standardized column names and types using Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing and Erroneous Data:**  \n",
    "   Some records were missing critical fields like transaction amount or user ID. I used Pandas’ .fillna() and custom logic to impute missing values where possible, or excluded records if essential information was absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardizing Categorical Variables:**  \n",
    "   Payment methods, device types, and regions were listed in various formats. I used mapping dictionaries in Pandas to unify these, and converted them to category dtype to save memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timestamp Normalization:**  \n",
    "   Timestamps came in different time zones and formats. Using Pandas’ to_datetime() and tz_convert(), I converted all dates to UTC in a consistent format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deduplication and Anomaly Detection:**  \n",
    "   I removed exact and near-duplicate transactions using Pandas’ .duplicated() and SQL DISTINCT queries. For anomaly detection, I flagged outliers (like negative transactions or implausible amounts) for further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
    "   After cleaning, I created derived features such as transaction frequency per user, average purchase value, and time since last transaction, which are crucial for fraud detection modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges Faced:**  \n",
    "- **Data Volume:** The datasets were too large to fit in memory. I processed data in chunks and performed aggregations in SQL when possible.\n",
    "- **Preserving Fraud Indicators:** I had to be careful not to remove outliers or anomalies that could indicate fraud. This required close collaboration with the modeling team to define cleaning rules.\n",
    "- **Source Inconsistencies:** Aligning fields from different sources took time, especially when metadata was lacking or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "By combining Pandas for flexible in-memory processing and SQL for large-scale operations, I was able to transform chaotic raw data into a clean, unified dataset ready for fraud detection modeling, ensuring both data quality and the retention of important fraud signals."

    "**Question 3: Data Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: You have a labeled dataset for a customer churn prediction model. Describe how you would detect and handle common data quality issues like missing values, mislabeled data, and duplicate records.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:  \n",
    "To detect missing values, I’d use `df.isna().sum()` in Pandas to quantify nulls per column and visualize their distribution with a heatmap. I’d impute numerical missing values with the mean or median (based on skewness) and categorical values with the mode or a placeholder like “Unknown”. For mislabeled data, I’d inspect label consistency (e.g., churn as “Yes”/“Y”/1) using `df['churn'].value_counts()` and standardize to binary (0/1). I’d also flag outliers in numerical features (e.g., via z-scores) that might indicate mislabeling. For duplicate records, I’d use `df.duplicated().sum()` to identify identical rows and drop them with `df.drop_duplicates()`. If duplicates involve a key (e.g., customer ID), I’d aggregate by keeping the most recent record. These steps ensure a clean, reliable dataset for modeling."

    "- Cleans the `price` column by removing '$' and commas, converting to float.  \n",
    "- Converts `host_is_superhost` to boolean (t/f to True/False).  \n",
    "- Calculates median prices by `neighbourhood_cleansed` and `host_is_superhost`.  \n",

    "- Displays a bar plot for the top neighborhoods by price gap.  \n",
